Gameplay Features:
Using mouse to control ball shooting(angle to shoot, power, etc)
Randomize ball location
Different camera angles to help player shoot
Need to generalize the current projectile motion for basketball (players will shoot at different angles and powers and will need to account for wind)
Effects of wind on ball
Tools for player to control the environment(ie wind speed or environment)
When ball get shot, the camera follows the ball when it gets shot
Collisions
Score keeping <- how do we know when the player has scored a shot?

Modeling, animation, and lighting:
Need an outside and inside environment (maybe like trees for outside background and an audience for inside?)
Spinning the basketball while it spins
Lighting (outside will have the sun, idk what to do about inside)
Different lighting for different times of day we set our current environment on - night, day, or sunset/sunrise
Two options, we could either have preset times for each time cycle or have each time cycle naturally into one another <- ie the lighting naturally transitions into each other
Shadows <- keep in mind the ballâ€™s shadow needs to be updated in real time
